# German Credit Risk

In 2008, defaults on subprime mortgages combined with bad corporate practices pushed the world to a recession. a few prominent financial institutions filed for bankruptcies. In the post-2008 era, it becomes important for the banks to identify potential defaulters based on available information.


I am using the German Credit Risk dataset from the book 'Hands-On Ensemble Learning with R'(Tattar,2018) to develop the classification. The dataset is an adoption of the original dataset provided by Prof. Hoffmann and available on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)

It has 1000 observations and 20 independent variables ("checking" "duration" "history" "purpose" "amount" "savings" "employed" "installp" "marital" "coapp" "resident" "property" "age" "housing" "existcr" "job" "depends" "telephon" "foreign"). The final status is captured in column "good_bad"
