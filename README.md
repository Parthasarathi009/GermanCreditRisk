# German Credit Risk

In 2008 , defaults on subprime mortgages combined with bad corporate practices, pushed the world to a recession. few prominant financial institutions  filed for bankrupcies. In post 2008 era, it becomes impotant for the banks to identify potential defaulters based on available information .

I am using the German Credit Risk dataset from the book 'Hands-On Ensemble Learning with R'(Tattar,2018) to develope the classification . The dataset is a adoption of the original dataset provided by Prof. Hoffmann and available on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)
